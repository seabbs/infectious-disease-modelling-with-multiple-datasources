### Risk Management

**High-Risk Areas:**
1. **Case Study Schematic Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Focus on plans and schematics rather than full implementation
   - Backup: Prepare simplified conceptual examples if detailed plans too complex

2. **Data Sources Section Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Clear sub-issue boundaries and deadlines
   - Backup: Focus on most critical data source types if time constrained

3. **Methodology Integration Challenges**
   - Mitigation: Regular coordination between Anne Presanis and Sam Abbott
   - Backup: Separate methodology into more modular sections if needed

**Quality Assurance:**
- GitHub issue tracking for all major components
- Regular milestone reviews with go/no-go decisions
- External review built into timeline rather than added at end
